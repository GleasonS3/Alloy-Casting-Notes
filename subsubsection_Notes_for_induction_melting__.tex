\subsubsection{Notes for induction melting of \MgZnCa alloy.}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \MgZnCa alloy melts around $400^{\circ}C$
\item Melting should be under an inert atmosphere (UNSW uses Ar).
\item Alloy surface should cleaned with a light sanding 320 grit sanding
\item ingot should be packed to maximise crucible ingot wall contact
\item small crucible holds 40cc, the large 60cc
\item If induction currents do not provide sufficent stirring, this can be accomplished manually via a small W wire. 
\item Return spent crucibles to UNSW for reservicing. 
\end{itemize}
