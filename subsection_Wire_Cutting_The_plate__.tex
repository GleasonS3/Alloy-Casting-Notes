\subsection{Wire Cutting}
The plate supplied should be sufficient to cut a flat nominal 49mm diameter target. This should be taken from the right half of the plate (see \ref{fig:Casting}). 

Notes before working with the plate.
\begin{itemize}
\item Plat is very fragile and \textbf{must} be handled with great care. 
\item Examine the plate fractures as it may have been damaged during shipping. 
\item The left half of the plate suffered from thermal fractures and was already damaged (see \ref{fig:Casting}).  
\end{itemize}

a section of the plate has already been fractured a large fracture 

If required the casting riser and left half of the plate may be carefully removed.
