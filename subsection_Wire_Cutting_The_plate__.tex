\subsection{Wire Cutting}
The plate supplied should be sufficient to cut a nominal 49mm diameter, 4mm thick target. This should be taken from the right half of the plate (see \ref{fig:Casting}). 

Notes before working with the plate.
\begin{itemize}
\item The plate is very fragile and \textbf{must} be handled with great care. 
\item Examine the plate for fractures as it may have been damaged during shipping. 
\item The damage to the left half of the plate resulted thermal stresses during manufacture. (see \ref{fig:Casting}). 
\item Do not remove the left side of the plate. This cause crack growth into the 'target area' on the right side.
\item If possible the riser should not be removed as removal could case crack growth into the 'target area.'
\end{itemize}
