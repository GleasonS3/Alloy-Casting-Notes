\subsection{Casting}

The \MgZnCa alloy must only be induction melted within a boron nitride crucible. Once the molten alloy is cast, the crucible may \textbf{NOT} be used again. 

These crucibles may only be used \textbf{ONCE}. (I.E. melt alloy within crucible, pore alloy to cast, crucible no longer usable. 

Notes for induction melting of \MgZnCa alloy.

\item Return spent crucibles to UNSW for reservicing.
