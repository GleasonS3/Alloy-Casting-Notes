\subsection{Casting}

The \MgZnCa alloy must only be induction melted within a \textbf{boron nitride crucible}. Once the molten alloy is cast, the crucible may \textbf{NOT} be used again (I.E. melt alloy within crucible, pore alloy to cast, crucible no longer usable. 

Notes for induction melting of \MgZnCa alloy.
