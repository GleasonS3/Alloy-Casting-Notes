\subsection{Casting}

The \MgZnCa alloy must only be induction melted within a \textbf{boron nitride crucible}. Once the molten alloy is cast, the crucible may \textbf{NOT} be used again (I.E. melt the alloy within crucible, pore the alloy to cast, crucible no longer usable). 

\textbf{Ingot heating cycle}
\begin{itemize}
\item \MgZnCa alloy ingots and pieces should be heated to $650^{\circ}C$ to full melt
\item Once melted the alloy should be cooled to $385^{\circ}C$
\item The alloy should then be reheated to $650^{\circ}C$
\item And finally cast below $500^{\circ}C$
\item This heating/cooling cycle helps insure a homogeneous alloy.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes for induction melting of \MgZnCa alloy.}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \MgZnCa alloy melts around $400^{\circ}C$
\item 
\item 
\item
\item Return spent crucibles to UNSW for reservicing. 
\end{itemize}
