\subsection{Casting}

The \MgZnCa alloy must only be induction melted within a \textbf{boron nitride crucible}. Once the molten alloy is cast, the crucible may \textbf{NOT} be used again (I.E. melt the alloy within crucible, pore the alloy to cast, crucible no longer usable). 

\subsubsection{Ingot heating cycle}

This heating/cooling cycle helps insure a homogeneous alloy melt.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \MgZnCa  alloy ingots/pieces should be heated to $650^{\circ}C$ to a full melt
\item Once melted the alloy should be cooled to $385^{\circ}C$
\item The alloy should then be reheated to $650^{\circ}C$
\item The alloy should then be cooled below $500^{\circ}C$ and cast into the mould
\item Do NOT cast last liquid from the crucible as this is slag with bad properties. 
\end{itemize}
