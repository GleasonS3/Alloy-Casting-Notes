\subsection{Casting}

The \MgZnCa alloy must only be induction melted within a \textbf{boron nitride crucible}. Once the molten alloy is cast, the crucible may \textbf{NOT} be used again (I.E. melt alloy within crucible, pore alloy to cast, crucible no longer usable. 

Ingot heating cycle
\MgZnCa alloy should be heated to 650$^{\circ}$ C to full melt, then cooled to 380 C, reheated to 650 C, and finally cast at 510 C.
