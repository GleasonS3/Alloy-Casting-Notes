\section{\MgZnCa Alloy Notes}

\subsection{Background}

The \MgZnCa alloy is nominally 65 at\% Mg, 30 \% Zn, and 5\% Ca. It is produced from constituent elements of pure Mg (99.85 wt\%), Zn (99.995 wt\%), and Ca (99.8 wt\%). 

The \MgZnCa alloy is \textbf{VERY} brittle. It must be handled with extremely care to avoid fracturing the alloy.
