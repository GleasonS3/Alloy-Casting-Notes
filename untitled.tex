\section{\MgZnCa Alloy Notes}

\section{Background}
The \MgZnCa alloy is a nominal 65 at\% Mg, 30 \%Zn, and 5\%Ca. It is produced from pure alloy constituent elements of Mg (99.85 wt\%), Zn (99.995 wt\%), and Ca (99.8 wt\%). 

The \MgZnCa alloy is \textbf{VERY} brittle. Be extremely careful when handling it.
