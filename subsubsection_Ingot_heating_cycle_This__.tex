\subsubsection{Ingot heating cycle}

This heating/cooling cycle helps insure a homogeneous alloy melt.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \MgZnCa alloy ingots/pieces should be heated to $650^{\circ}C$ to a full melt
\item Once molten the alloy should be cooled to $385^{\circ}C$
\item The alloy should then be reheated to $650^{\circ}C$
\item The alloy is then cooled below $500^{\circ}C$ and gravity cast into the mold
\item Note the last of the melt will be slag with undesirable properties. This final amount of the melt should NOT be cast.
\end{itemize}
