\subsubsection{Ingot heating cycle}

This heating/cooling cycle helps insure a homogeneous alloy melt.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \MgZnCa alloy ingot pieces should be heated to a full melt at $650^{\circ}C$;
\item Once molten the alloy should be allowed to cool to $385^{\circ}C$ (Note complete solidification is not necessary);
\item The alloy should then be reheated to a full melt at $650^{\circ}C$;
\item The alloy is then cooled below $500^{\circ}C$ and gravity cast into the mold; and
\item Note: after completing this heating cycle there will be a small amount of slag floating on top of the melt. Poring should be done such that the slag remaining in the crucible and does not enter the casting.
\end{itemize}
