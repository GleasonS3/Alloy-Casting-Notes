\subsubsection{Ingot heating cycle}

This heating/cooling cycle helps insure a homogeneous alloy melt.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \MgZnCa alloy ingot pieces should be heated to a full melt at $650^{\circ}C$;
\item Once molten the alloy should be allowed to cool to $385^{\circ}C$ (Note complete solidification is not necessary);
\item The alloy should then be reheated to a full melt at $650^{\circ}C$;
\item The alloy is then cooled below $500^{\circ}C$ and gravity cast into the mold; and
\item Note: after completing this heating cycle there will be a small amount of slag floating on top of the melt. As slag has undesirable properties pouring should be done such that this slag remains within the crucible and does not enter the casting.
\end{itemize}
