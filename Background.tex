\section{\MgZnCa Alloy Notes}

\subsection{Background}

The \MgZnCa alloy is nominally 65at\% Mg, 30at\% Zn, and 5at\% Ca. It is produced from constituent elements of pure Mg (99.85wt\%), Zn (99.995wt\%), and Ca (99.8wt\%). 

Note the \MgZnCa alloy is \textbf{VERY} brittle. It \textbf{MUST} be handled with extremely care to avoid damaging and/or fracturing the material. test
